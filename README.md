Using OpenCV and Python, a basic feature based ball detecting algorithm was developed through the shape and colour of the basketball. Using a defined colour range, a mask was generated and the shape of the ball was detected by the circularity of the contours present in the mask.
<br><br>
Motion-JPEG was used to facilitate the streaming of the final video footage to the flask server web app. The criteria for switching was established as the radius of the ball. The switching algorithm ensured seem-less transition between camera feeds. The web app allows full scalability in the use of custom detection algorithms, and switching logic.
